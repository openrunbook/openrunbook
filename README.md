# Open Runbook

Open Runbook is a public runbook for operating modern software systems. Modern software systems are complex and take a lot of tribal knowledge to run. Open Runbook aims to be a place to capture document some of that tribal knowledge. If you are running an open source software, open runbook can be a starting point for effectively running the service.

Each folder in the project will contain a runbook for that service. The runbook will be a single page. In addition, the runbook can contain additional assets like public dashboards and configurations.

# FAQ

## Why does this project exist?
* We are tired of haphazardly hunting through messy threads of GitHub issues and StackOverflow during an incident.
* We donâ€™t want a one-off fix, we want to deepen our understanding of the problem space and have somewhat decent solutions to try.
* We want to give people a resource where they can benefit from our collective experience of running systems.
* We want to share best practices for writing runbooks.

## This runbook seems incomplete?
A runbook is a very customized to a specific environment. Since these runbooks are meant to be as general purpose as possible, they typically would have some holes in them where general commands would go in. So, they may appear incomplete. But, they are definitely better than the alternatives out there.
