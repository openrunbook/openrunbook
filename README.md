# Open Runbook

Open Runbook is a public runbook for operating modern software systems. Modern software systems are complex and take a lot of tribal knowledge to run. Open Runbook aims to be a place to capture document some of that tribal knowledge. If you are running an open source software, open runbook can be a starting point for effectively running the service.

Each folder in the project will contain a runbook for that service. The runbook will be a single page. In addition, the runbook can contain additional assets like public dashboards and configurations.
