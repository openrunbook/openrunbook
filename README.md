# Open Runbook

Open Runbook is a public runbook for operating modern software systems. Modern software systems are complex and take a lot of tribal knowledge to run. Open Runbook aims to be a place to capture document some of that tribal knowledge.

If you are running an open source service, open runbook can be a starting point for learning how to run your service.
